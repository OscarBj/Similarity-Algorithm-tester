# Similarity-Algorithm-tester
Similarity algorithm testing

This program is for testing string comparison algorithms and their performance.
The data which is used consists of 5000 words with the length of lenght 15 characters (generated using https://www.random.org/strings/). 

Performance metrics to be tested:
- time: Using System.Diagnostics stopwatch
-
-


How to:
	//TODO

Example usage:
	// TODO: db implementation

Recognition algorithms:

	-Levenshtein Distance
		Calculates character distance
			deletion, insertion, substitution, transposition
		Optimized version
			Algorithm breaks when score is exceeded

	-Dice Coefficient
		
	-Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
("word match" (from EIT project))

Note:
Keep in mind that one of the two strings compared is constant.
